SlidingBrickPuzzle

    SlidingBrickPuzzle is a library for representing Sliding Brick Puzzle game in Python. 
    The user can load a game state from a text file and apply different moves on the game state. 
    Moreover, the user can apply different search algorithms such as Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Iterative Deepening Search to solve the game state. 
    You can play the game here: https://www.mathplayground.com/slidingblock.html

        * output-hw1.txt - text output of running SlidingBrickPuzzleMain.py
        * SBP-level0.txt - sample game state level 0
        * SBP-level0.txt - sample game state level 1
        * hw1.sh - content: 'python3 SlidingBrickPuzzleMain.py'

    4. Command line examples
        ```python
        python3 SlidingBrickPuzzleMain.py
        ```

        ```python
        python3 SlidingBrickPuzzleMain.py > output-hw1.txt
        ```

II. Usage
    1. Run The Default Main Function Containing Examples
        `$ ./hw1.sh`

    2. Load A State From A File
        ```python
        import SlidingBrickPuzzle
        # Init a puzzle state
        puzzleState = State()
        # Load a state from file
        puzzleState.loadFromFile("SBP-level0.txt")
        ```

    3. Perform Random Walk And Print Out Results
        ```python
        import SlidingBrickPuzzle
        # Init a puzzle state
        puzzleState = State()
        # Load a state from file
        puzzleState.loadFromFile("SBP-level0.txt")
        ```

    4. Perform Breadth First Search And Print Out Results
        ```python
        import SlidingBrickPuzzle
        # Init a puzzle state
        puzzleState = State()
        # Load a state from file
        puzzleState.loadFromFile("SBP-level0.txt")
        #Solve the puzzle using BFS and print the solution
        solveUsingBreadthFirstSearch(puzzleState)
        ```

    5. Perform Depth First Search And Print Out Results
        ```python
        import SlidingBrickPuzzle
        # Init a puzzle state
        puzzleState = State()
        # Load a state from file
        puzzleState.loadFromFile("SBP-level0.txt")
        #Solve the puzzle using DFS and print the solution
        solveUsingDepthFirstSearch(puzzleState)
        ```

    6. Perform Iterative Deepening Search And Print Out Results
        ```python
        import SlidingBrickPuzzle
        # Init a puzzle state
        puzzleState = State()
        # Load a state from file
        puzzleState.loadFromFile("SBP-level0.txt")
        #Solve the puzzle using IDS and print the solution
        solveUsingIterativeDeepeningSearch(puzzleState)
        ```
